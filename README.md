# nonSTL 🚀

Welcome to **nonSTL**—the not-so-standard library of data structures and algorithms that doesn't lean on the crutch of the Standard Template Library (STL). If you've ever thought, "Sure, STL is great... but what if I did things my way?"—you're in the right place.

This library is a curated collection of code snippets that I've written, used, and tweaked for various programming challenges. It's my personal go-to toolbox for when I want to get things done *my way* (and when the STL isn't fancy enough). 

## Why nonSTL?

- **Custom-built**: STL is great, but here we’ve got *more flair*. Think of it like STL with a bit more personality. 
- **Optimized for clarity**: Each snippet is easy to follow, because who doesn't love clean code?
- **Minimal magic**: While STL sometimes feels like black magic, here you'll know exactly what's happening.
- **Humor-friendly**: Because solving DSA problems is stressful enough—why not have some fun?

## What's inside? 📦

A variety of data structures and algorithms, coded from scratch, with a touch of personality:

- **Linked Lists** - Because why use `std::list` when you can suffer through manual memory management?
- **Binary Trees** - Rooted, balanced, and only slightly bent out of shape.
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO, FIFO, FOMO—let’s get organized.
- **Graphs** - Let's get tangled in nodes and edges, the fun way.
- **Sorting Algorithms** - Because one `std::sort` is just too mainstream.
- **Dynamic Programming** - Code snippets that won’t forget... unless you tell them to.
- **Search Algorithms** - Faster than Ctrl+F (probably).

And many more gems to come...

## Installation ⚙️

Clone this repository like any sane developer would:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nonSTL.git
```

Then navigate to the library, pick a code snippet, and drop it into your project.

## Usage 👨‍💻

You can import and use the code snippets as building blocks for your projects. There's no "one-size-fits-all" here—this is more of a "one-size-fits-most" library. Feel free to tweak the codes to suit your needs. In fact, I encourage it. **Fork it, break it, make it yours.**

## Contributing 🛠️

Got a clever way to implement a B-tree? Want to improve the efficiency of a sorting algorithm? Contributions are welcome! Open an issue, submit a pull request, or just drop in for a chat.

## License 📜

This library is licensed under the MIT License. Basically, use it however you like, just don’t sue me if something goes wrong.

Happy coding, and may your pointers never segfault! ✨
